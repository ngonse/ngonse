### Hey there, I'm Nick! 

I'm a software engineer and part-time teacher who is passionate about all things JavaScript and mobile development. 

Currently, I'm diving deep into React, React Native and NextJS, while also learning TypeScript and exploring the world of Tailwind CSS. 

I'm always on the lookout for new challenges and opportunities to grow as a developer. Let's connect and build something awesome together!
